Pacman Reborn
Created by Abhijeet Pande

This project was created on the free IDE called Processing. It is the first fully created game by me, and was my final project for my Computer Science class in Grade 12. It involved 3 days of constant research and coding, but the end result was well worth the time that I put in. 

Instructions on how to run this game: 

1) Download and install the free IDE called Processing. (Download link: https://processing.org/download/) 
(Installation instructions: https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/) 

2)Download all the files in this repository

3)Double-click the .pde file to open it. This automatically creates a folder by the same name as the .pde file, in which all of the images must now be saved. This folder is usually located in \Users\{username}\Documents\Processing by default. 

4) now run the game, and enjoy!

Running tests on this project: There are currently no tests available to run on this project.
